    <string name="user_manual">The Home Screen contains two icons. \n The \"Snake is near me\" Icon. \n• Gives you an option to scan an image of the snake upon clicking it.\n •You can either click a picture or long press the icon to select an image from the gallery.\n• The ML model identifies the snake and gives the result whether it is venomous or not along with its breed.\n • You get an option to call the Snake Rescuers, so that they can safely carry it away from you.\n  The \"Snake has bitten me\" Icon.\n • This is an emergency icon. \n\n• You immediately get an option to call the snake helpline number. \n\n Also, we have sliding text messages on the home screen to reduce panic and misconceptions of users related to snakes.</string>
